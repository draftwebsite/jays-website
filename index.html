            <p class="" id="1-10">
                1.	Texans - CJ Stroud (QB- Ohio State)- If Houston is picking in the top 5, Davis Mills likely didn’t show enough to maintain a third year starting. They’ve done a decent job drafting. They still need a couple pieces on the line, but have a dominant left side of the line already with OT Tunsil and rookie OG Kenyon Green. They still need another weapon outside to complement Brandon Cooks. They opt for the QB that looked like a pro since his first year starting. Great size. Strong arm. Ball flies out of Stroud’s hand. Showed elite touch but can struggle with ball location. <br /> <br />
                2.	Falcons - Will Anderson (EDGE-Alabama) - Ridder shows enough despite not having London or Ridley and a subpar line. Everyone should already know this guys name. He’s the most dominant edge rusher to come out since Myles Garrett, and has already had a better year as a sophomore than Garrett ever did. I don’t think it’s close for best player in the class. Even though they need QB, they see Anderson as too rare a talent to pass on.<br /> <br />
                3.	Bears - Paris Johnson Jr. (OT- Ohio State) - GM Ryan Pace has a long leash going into his second draft as Bears’ GM. I think he rides with Fields one more year, which not only will appease the fan base, but give him a cheap young option at qb under contract for a couple more years. It certainly seems like they don’t see Fields as the guy but all of their moves that specifically have hurt the offense. They can move Fields to another team that was high on Fields next year and get back a Darnold-like package of picks. They take Paris Johnson Jr., an OT with perhaps the most upside in the draft along with Broderick Jones of Georgia. Johnson is 6’6, 315. 35.5 inch arms. He checks every box. He kicks out to replace Titans’ 3rd round pick Nicolas Petit-Frere. He showed flashes of dominant play at guard last year. I think he’s one of the few hyped Ohio State lineman that can live up to it. Pace wishes Anderson fell, but gladly takes the ultra-talented Johnson Jr. <br /> <br />
                4.	Panthers - Bryce Young (QB - Alabama) - This has to be QB right? Mayfield and Darnold are on expiring contracts. If the season goes this bad, Rhule and GM are gone, and so are their QBs.<br /> <br />
                5.	Jaguars - Kayshon Boutte (WR - LSU)<br /><br />
                6.	Giants - Anthony Richardson (QB - Florida) - The Giants need to get better everywhere but specifically at qb and cb. The Giants line is finally coming together. They still need a couple interior pieces but Richardson is stepping into a much better situation than Jones ever had. GM Joe Shoen helped draft the raw, but toolsy Josh Allen in Buffalo and Daboll coached him up dramatically over his first few years. Richardson is dynamic throwing from all platforms as well as tucking and running. There is no other qb in the class with his physical tools. If he puts it together in his first full season this year at Florida he will be a top 10 pick. Shoen takes a swing on the high upside young signal-caller. <br /> <br />
                7.	Seahawks - Kelee Ringo (CB - Georgia) <br /><br />
                8.	Lions - Will Levis (QB - Kentucky) - Detroit can’t keep running Jared Goff out there year after year. This roster, specifically their offense, is qb away from being dynamic. Think about it - Hockenson is one off the better tight ends in the league. They have a top 5 offensive line anchored by Penei Sewell who played great as a rookie at both left and right tackle. They have Jameson Williams - pure electricity - coming back from acl. St Brown gives them a shifty slot and the newly signed DJ Chark gives them size/speed on the outside and another deep threat along with Williams. Goff is now the ultimate barrier to Detroit’s success on offense. I’m not sold on Levis, but he has rare size/speed/arm strength. If he has a breakout year he will go top 15. He gives Dan Campbell a dynamic two way qb that can threaten the edge with his legs and stretch the field with his arm. Just needs to be a better processor and more consistent ball placement. <br /> <br />
                9.	Commanders - Myles Murphy (EDGE - Clemson) - Washington probably wanted to go qb but 4 went in the first 8 picks. They take a top 5 talent in the draft that slide because of qb value. You’re thinking, why would Washington draft another edge rusher with Young and Sweat coming back healthy. Murphy is different - and versatile. The Commanders here get the best edge after Anderson. Murphys highs are top ten worthy. He gave Ekwonu issues last year, one of the few. Can he stay healthy and put together a season even close to Hutchinsons? 6’5 275. He shows immense power, throwing tackles aside. Shows a great first step, especially for someone almost 280. Murphy is a traditional 4-3 end but could play in any system with his athleticism and frame. He could emerge early as a consensus top 5 non-QB. With Washington playing a 4 man fronts, Murphy could play DT on passing downs and running downs. And with Young and Sweats injury history, Murphy will likely just kick out to his natural position of 4-3 edge. He makes a great defensive line elite. Pair him next to Jonathon Allen, Young, and Sweat and that’s top 5 in the league.<br /> <br />
                
            
            </p>
            <p class="" id="11-20">
          10.	Jets - Broderick Jones (OT - Georgia) - I don’t believe you can enter year 3 of a rebuild with 38 year Duane Brown and 31 year old George Fant. Becton is probably done as a Jet with his second season ending injury in his first 3 years. With the Jets prioritizing playmakers highly in the draft, Wilson, Moore, Hall, Ruckert. Jones only played 4 games last year filling in for the injured Jamaree Salyer but flashed dominance. He will be Georgias’ full time blind side protector for the first time this year and I expect a massive year. He runs a sub 5.0 40 at 6’4 315. He brings big power and moves people in the run game with the athleticism to develop into a great pass blocker. Even if Zach Wilson flops in year 3, you now have one of the more intriguing young offensive cores in the league for the next qb. <br /> 
          11.	Steelers - Peter Skoronski (OT - Northwestern) - Pittsburgh has trotted out subpar offensive lines for several years running. They finally address it here with a top 3 OT in the class. After this year, he will have the best 3 years of tape of any OT in the class. His reason for going 3/3 for the tier 1 OTs behind Paris Johnson Jr and Broderick Jones is physical upside. Skoronski stands 6’4, 300. His arms are rumored to possibly be less than the 33 inch ‘benchmark’. That typically means you kick inside but Skoronski has played every position at a high level. He doesn’t lose reps often. Even if Skoronski were to struggle at OT, he was recruited as a center and can also play elite level guard. A truly rare 5-position versatile player. <br /> <br />
	        12.	Patriots - Jalen Carter (IDL - Georgia) - The Patriots roster is a barren wasteland. They are about to lose their starting LT Isaiah Wynn. Their RT Trent Brown is never healthy. They have only Tyquan Thornton for dynamic weapons outside. New England has Christian Barmore and Matthew Judon on defense. They lost JC Jackson and have no young CB to take his spot. CB Cam Smith is an option here. Instead they take a top 5 talent that fell a bit because of the lower value of inferior defensive line. Carter is an elite disruptive in both facets. He and Barmore could make the best defensive tackle pair in the league. With Judon outside, the Patriots are one edge player away from having a top 5 line. <br /><br />
	        13.	Eagles (Saints) - Isaiah Foskey (EDGE - Notre Dame) - Philly has one of the worst edge rooms in the entire league. It’s the only thing holding this defense back from being elite, as least as far as starters go. Bradberry and Slay give you two really good corners. Nakobe Dean gives them an answer in the middle and Jordan Davis up front with Fletcher Cox is going to be a problem. Foskey is the 4-3 edge types the eagles like. Long, athletic and powerful, he immediately improves their rush defense on the edge. His pass rush arsenal is very limited and he needs to refine it this season but he has the tools of a 1st round edge player. <br /><br />
	        14.	Texans (Browns) - Cam Smith (CB - South Carolina) - Houston wants to run a bunch of tight man coverage. They took Stingley last year. Cam Smith would give them one of the best pairs in the league. Excellent ball skills. Physical in the run game. I love his game. He’s not a 4.3 athlete which is why he won’t go top 5 but he could sneak into the back half of the top 10 if QBs don’t rise. <br /><br />
	        15.	Cardinals - Andrew Vorhees (OG/OT - USC) - Kyler Murray has shown that inside pressure is so much more disruptive than edge pressure around the corner against him because he can’t just take off outside and break contain when the pressure is in his face and the edge players keep contain. His height becomes a major barrier here and it’s one of the reasons he’s struggled so much over the middle of the field as a passer. Vorhees is one of ‘my guys’. I thought he would have came out last year but he’s staying for an extra year to play under Lincoln Riley. Vorhees made Feldman’s freaks list for his strength. At 6’6, 320, he benched 225 over 40 times. He’s played guard and tackle so he gives some flexibility on the line. He will sure up either guard spot and give Murray a clean pocket. <br /> <br />
	        16.	Vikings - Antonio Johnson (DB - Texas A&M) - Minnesota has a ton of needs on the back end of their defense. Johnson gives them a safety/slot player and another playmaker to pair with the aging Harrison Smith. Outside of maybe interior offensive line and tight end, the Vikings don’t have holes on offense. There aren’t any QBs worth taking here so they opt for defense. <br /> <br />
	        17.	Cowboys - Michael Mayor (TE - Notre Dame) - Jerry loves his stars and Mayor brings star power. Often called mini-gronk, he’s shined at Notre Dame in both run and pass. He isn’t the athlete or route runner Pitts was which is why he won’t go top 5. Mayor let’s them let Shultz walk while arguably even getting a better version. He makes their run game even better and brings sure hands over the middle. <br /> <br />
	        18.	Raiders - Quentin Johnston (WR - TCU) - The AFC West is an arms race. Johnston is another one of ‘my guys’. 6’4, 210, 4.4 athlete with a 40+ vertical jump. Shown great strength at the catch point. Broke 27 tackles on 55 catches. His qb play is atrocious. He’s not likely going to have the stats that Boutte and Smith-Njigba because of it. Don’t be fooled. lPairing this size/speed/strength freak to stretch the field opposite Devante Adams. Let Hunter Renfrow and Waller own the middle of the field. Vegas has a chance to be special. The only thing that can derail that is their offensive line. They desperately need 1st round pick Alex Leatherwood to at least be average at RT or RG which hasn’t shown he can do. <br /> <br />

            <p class="" id="20-on">
              19.	Colts - Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR - Ohio State) - Indy has to get more dynamic outside. Pittman Jr is a nice X WR but they have no one that can stretch the field or dominate from the slot now that TY Hilton is near the end of his career. Smith-Njigba showed he could do both. He’s not going to blow up the combine. I don’t even think he’ll run a 4.4 flat. But there are sometimes receivers in college that just understand the position and nuances that come with it. He his excellent on choice routes and is quick in and out of breaks. He knows how to get open. <br />
              20.	Eagles - Eli Ricks (CB - Alabama) - Philly grabs one of the best zone corners in the draft with some off-field concerns. <br /> <br />
              21.	Seahawks (Broncos) - Noah Sewell (ILB - Oregon) - What is Seattles plan? It seems Pete Caroll wants to keep this build/rebuild? going. He’s the old school type that will value a huge downhill presence. He’s not Bobby Wagner but he’s really good. <br /> <br />
	            22.	Bengals - Anton Harrison (OT - Oklahoma)<br /> <br />
	            23.	Dolphins - Bryan Bresee (IDL - Clemson)<br /> <br />
	            24.	Titans - Darnell Wright (OT/OG - Tennessee) - Tennessee needs to get back to doing what they do best and run the ball to set up the pass, just to grind you down with Henry to finish. Dupree should be healthy this year and a nice pair with Harold Landry. I still considered EDGEs Will McDonald IV and Felix Anudika-Uzomah. They’ve spent a 1st and 2nd rd pick the last two seasons at corner, plus Fulton. They are relatively set at safety. WR was an option but I don’t love anyone enough for this pick. I’m not sold on Petit-Frere at OT. You can slide him inside/let him be the swing tackle off the bench that inevitable plays a lot. The Titans scouts get to watch Darnell Wright play just down the street. 6’5 330. Power. Already an impressive run blocker. I have some questions about his lateral mobility at times but he is finally settling at one spot on the line in the SEC. He’s played both tackle spots so far. I think Wright projects perfectly as a RT in either power/gap or even zone-schemes, which also alleviates some of his foot speed concerns. His tape against Alabama was solid. I think with another good year he will become a late 1st/early 2nd OT.<br /> <br />
	            25.	Ravens - Will McDonald IV (EDGE-Iowa State) - The Ravens hit a quiet home run with this pick. No one watches him because he plays at Iowa State. Maybe my #1 ‘my guy’. 6’4, 245. 34 5/8 in arms. 42 inch vertical jump. 4.6 40. Production in back to back years: 10+ sacks and 13+TFLs. He checks every box besides run defense. He can get moved off the ball with double teams and needs to add 10 lbs to his frame but his length and explosiveness make him an insane partner to Jayson Oweh. Baltimore’s defense is starting to reload. <br /> <br />
	            26.	Packers - Joey Porter Jr (CB)<br /> <br />
	            27.	Chargers - Jaelyn Duncan (OT - Maryland) - LA just needs a RT and their oline rebuild is complete. All of the guys the Chargers have drafted/signed could move well and were technically sound - Slater, Johnson, Linsley. Duncan isn’t in Slaters/ Sewells or Neal/Ekwonu, or even the top 3 OTs tier this year. But I came away from his tape impressed overall. 6’6 320.  33 1/4 inch arms. Tons of starts. Showed ability to get to second level. I worry about his average length and average athleticism, he also was flagged 10 times, but with one more year of great tape against better competition he could definitely enter late 1st, 2nd round latest. Maryland has a bunch of NFL talent. They could surprise some people with better coaching/QB play. <br /> <br />
	            28.	Lions (Rams) - Trenton Simpson (ILB)<br /> <br />
	            29.	Chiefs - Brandon Joseph (S) KC needs to replace the honey bager. <br /> <br />
	            30.	Buccaneers - Siaka Ika (IDL)<br /> <br />
                31. Bills - <br />
